cfortran (4.4-13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.0 (no changes).
  * Make the default behavior on CYGWIN, Linux (with gcc) and OS X be to
    assume gfortran (rather than g77/f2c) if the FORTRAN compiler has
    otherwise been left unspecified.  Thanks Davide Mancusi for the prod.
  * Fix a buffer overrun bug found by Jean-Guillaume Piccinali in one of
    the example programs (fd/fd.c).  (Closes: #489886.)

cfortran (4.4-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.7.3 (no changes).
  * Restore commented-out "extern" in COMMON_BLOCK_DEF() macro, by
    request of Jacek Holeczek <jacek.m.holeczek@gmail.com>.
    N.B. This will cause "paw" source package to FTBFS due to a
    Debian-specific patch to paw, so I will upload a fix for that shortly.
  * Add {} around lone ";" in three empty "while" bodies to get rid of
    spurious compiler warnings with recent gcc.  Thanks to Rene Brun
    <Rene.Brun@cern.ch>.
  * Change package recommends from g77 to gfortran.
  * Add README.Debian to mention that most people using gfortran will want
    to use -DgFortran (those using g77 will want to keep using -Dg77Fortran
    or -Df2cFortran) and to discuss the differences.

cfortran (4.4-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.7.2 (no changes).
  * Build-Depends: debhelper (instead of Build-Depends-Indep) to fix
    Lintian error.

 -- Kevin B. McCarty <kmccarty@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Nov 2006 09:16:31 -0500

cfortran (4.4-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add modifications so that gfortran (and g77 with -fno-f2c flag) are
    supported when the C/C++ compiler is invoked with flag -DgFortran
    (or gFortran is otherwise #define'd).  Possibly at some later time when
    gfortran is the default FORTRAN compiler on Debian, this will be made
    the default.  Thanks to William Pence <pence@milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov>
    for bringing up the issue.  Mentioned in debian/NEWS.
  * Add modifications by William Pence to define a LONGLONG type more
    carefully.
  * Bump debian/compat to 5.

 -- Kevin B. McCarty <kmccarty@debian.org>  Wed,  5 Apr 2006 17:01:35 -0400

cfortran (4.4-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add modifications from Martin Reinecke <martin@MPA-Garching.MPG.DE>
    for partial INTEGER*8 (long long) support.
  * Not updating the documentation yet as the cfitsio team has requested
    to leave this feature undocumented for now.

 -- Kevin B. McCarty <kmccarty@debian.org>  Fri, 23 Dec 2005 08:21:35 -0500

cfortran (4.4-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * cfortran.h: Improved to enforce the fact that f2c and g77 generate code
    from FORTRAN REAL functions that returns a C "double".  This should fix
    runtime code breakage on some platforms such as AMD64.  See NEWS.Debian
    for more information.
  * cfortran.doc and cfortran.html: updated to reflect the change.

 -- Kevin B. McCarty <kmccarty@debian.org>  Fri,  9 Dec 2005 17:43:06 -0500

cfortran (4.4-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update FSF address in debian/copyright.
  * Update maintainer email in debian/control and debian/copyright.
  * Update debhelper compatibility to version 4.
  * Update Standards-Version to 3.6.2 (no changes).
  * Clean up debian/rules a bit.
  * Unpack cfortran.examples.tar.gz into /usr/share/doc/cfortran/examples
    to make it easier to explore (removing unneeded symlinks *.C -> *.c).

 -- Kevin B. McCarty <kmccarty@debian.org>  Tue, 22 Nov 2005 13:35:38 +0000

cfortran (4.4-6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Recommend "gcc | c-compiler" and "g77 | fortran-compiler" instead of
    just the virtual packages.  This avoids the situation of a person
    naively installing cfortran with aptitude and ending up with some
    random little-known compilers.

 -- Kevin B. McCarty <kmccarty@princeton.edu>  Fri, 10 Dec 2004 08:53:47 -0500

cfortran (4.4-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Install a symlink from /usr/include/cfortran/cfortran.h to
    /usr/include/cfortran.h, since some build systems expect to find
    cfortran.h (and various other Cernlib include files) in
    /usr/include/cfortran.  Fixes part of #243860.

 -- Kevin B. McCarty <kmccarty@princeton.edu>  Wed, 28 Apr 2004 13:20:50 -0400

cfortran (4.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * cfortran.h: Add support for Intel Fortran compiler by #defining f2cFortran
    when it's used or INTEL_COMPILER is #defined (closes: #222318).

 -- Kevin B. McCarty <kmccarty@princeton.edu>  Sat, 29 Nov 2003 17:38:03 -0500

cfortran (4.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/copyright: Add email from upstream licensing cfortran under LGPL.
    Correct licensing statement; upstream licensed it specifically under
    Library GPL (i.e. version 2), not Lesser GPL (i.e. version 2.1).
  * debian/changelog: Remove emacs variable cruft from the bottom.
  * debian/control: Standards-Version now 3.6.1 (no changes).

 -- Kevin B. McCarty <kmccarty@princeton.edu>  Fri, 10 Oct 2003 14:54:52 -0400

cfortran (4.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * No longer conflict with current cfitsio-dev, as it no longer includes
    a cfortran.h file.
  * Merge small modifications (mainly more "#if defined" tests) from
    CFITSIO code.

 -- Kevin B. McCarty <kmccarty@princeton.edu>  Mon,  3 Mar 2003 11:19:26 +0100

cfortran (4.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: use Build-Depends-Indep instead of Build-Depends
  * Remove README.debian; edit cfortran.h to auto-detect gcc with __GNUC__.
  * Fix a few more typos in documentation.

 -- Kevin B. McCarty <kmccarty@princeton.edu>  Sat, 18 Jan 2003 18:14:37 +0100

cfortran (4.4-0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Escape "&", "<" and ">" characters in HTML documentation and fix a
    couple of typos.
  * Include note in cfortran.{html,doc} that it is now also licensed
    under LGPL.

 -- Kevin B. McCarty <kmccarty@princeton.edu>  Sat, 18 Jan 2003 13:23:14 +0100

cfortran (4.4-0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix links in HTML documentation.
  * Add cfortran.examples.tar.gz package to examples directory.

 -- Kevin B. McCarty <kmccarty@princeton.edu>  Sun,  8 Dec 2002 04:01:11 +0100

cfortran (4.4-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release as a Debian package.
