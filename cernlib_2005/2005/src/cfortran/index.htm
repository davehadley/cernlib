<h2>
cfortran.h :  Interfacing C or C++ and FORTRAN
</h2>

cfortran.h is an easy-to-use powerful bridge between C and FORTRAN.<br>
It provides a transparent, machine independent interface between<br>
C and FORTRAN routines and global data.<br>
<br>
C and C++ are generally equivalent as far as cfortran.h is concerned.<br>
Unless explicitly noted otherwise, mention of C implicitly includes C++.<br>
<br>
The following presentation is a good introduction to mixed language programming.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burkhard D. Burow. "Mixed Language Programming",<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Computing in High Energy Physics (CHEP'95), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sept. 1995, editors R. Shellard and T.Nguyen, World Scientific, pp. 610-614.<br>
Here is the <a href="http://www-zeus.desy.de/~burow/cfortran/CHEP95.cfortran.h.paper.ps">paper</a>
and the <a href="http://www-zeus.desy.de/~burow/cfortran/CHEP95.cfortran.h.talk.ps">slides</a> of the presentation.<br>
It introduces cfortran.h and alternative methods for mixed language programming<br>
and thus can help you decide if cfortran.h can be of use to you.<br>
<br>
Knowing its popularity might help you decide if cfortran.h can be of use to you.<br>
The following is my best estimate of the number of users of cfortran.h.<br>
Since its first release in 1990, <a href="mailto:burow@desy.de">I</a> have exchanged e-mails with hundreds of users of cfortran.h.<br>
Assuming that a small fraction of users of cfortran.h ever send me e-mail,<br>
then cfortran.h has a few thousand users. You easily can find users in a www search.<br>
<br>
<br>
The cfortran.h software consists of the single C header file <a href="file:///usr/include/cfortran.h">cfortran.h</a>.<br>
<br>
The documentation is the single file <a href="cfortran.html">cfortran.html</a>.<br>
The documentation also is available at its original location <a href="http://wwwinfo.cern.ch/asd/cernlib/cfortran.html">http://wwwinfo.cern.ch/asd/cernlib/cfortran.html</a>.<br>
The documentation also is available as the gzipped ASCII file <a href="cfortran.doc.gz">cfortran.doc.gz</a>.<br>
<br>
A variety of small independent applications are available to test and demonstrate cfortran.h.<br>
All the applications are contained in
<!--a compressed tar file <a href="examples/cfortran.examples.tar.gz">cfortran.examples.tar.gz</a>.<br>
The following will unpack the applications into a directory named eg/.<br>
The program zcat is the GNU version or compatible.<br>
unix&gt; zcat cfortran.examples.tar.gz | tar xf -<br> -->
the <a href = "examples/">examples</a> directory.
<br>
Though NOT recommended for most purposes,<br>
the above applications also are available in a single C file <a href="examples/cfortest.c">cfortest.c</a><br>
and a single Fortran file <a href="examples/cfortex.f">cfortex.f</a>.<br>
<br>
<br>
If cfortran.h has served you well, you may want to look at the recent instance of graph reduction<br>
described at <a href="http://www-zeus.desy.de/~funnel/TSIA/index.htm">http://www-zeus.desy.de/~funnel/TSIA/index.htm</a>.<br>
cfortran.h provides an application with transparent mixed language programming.<br>
In other words, cfortran.h hides the details of mixed language programming from the application.<br>
In a similar vein, graph reduction (a.k.a. dataflow) has long promised transparent parallelism,<br>
reliability and other execution features. The promises have not been fulfilled, since graph reduction<br>
lacked a practical implementation. Though not yet widely known, practical graph reduction recently<br>
has been achieved.<br>
