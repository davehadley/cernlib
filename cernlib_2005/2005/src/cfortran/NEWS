cfortran (4.4-10) unstable; urgency=low

  cfortran.h has been enhanced to support the gfortran compiler.  Use the
  flag -DgFortran to your C/C++ compiler, or #define gFortran somewhere in
  your source code above the #include <cfortran.h>.  Doing this is also
  likely necessary if you use g77 with the -fno-f2c flag, or f2c with the
  -R flag.

cfortran (4.4-8) unstable; urgency=low

  In this version of cfortran, the header file cfortran.h has been improved,
  as planned by the original author, to enforce the fact that f2c and g77
  generate code from FORTRAN REAL functions that returns a C "double".
  This should fix runtime breakage with cfortran on some platforms (e.g.
  AMD64); see for instance http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=15397

  If you create libraries that depend upon cfortran to build, it is possible
  that this change could affect the ABI of your library.  Be particularly
  alert to this possibility if you use the PROTOCCALLSFFUN* and/or
  FCALLSCFUN* macros with the first argument to the macro(s) (i.e. the
  function return type) being "FLOAT".
